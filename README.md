# Chess_AI

This is my personal project to build a simple chess AI from scratch.  
The main goal is to create a console-based chess game where I can play against the AI,  
and then gradually improve it.

## Current status
- Basic board setup.
- Piece movement + move validation.
- History stack and undo feature.
- Running in console with simple text UI.

## Next steps
- Special rules (promotion, en passant, castling)
- Add simple AI responses (random moves first, improve later).

## How to run
Clone the repo and run `main.py`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NRCEM/chess-ai.git
cd chess-ai
python main.py
```

## Here’s an example of the current console output:
```
--------------------------
r n b q k b n r
p p p p p p p p
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .

. . . . . . . .
P P P P P P P P
R N B Q K B N R

Your turn:
