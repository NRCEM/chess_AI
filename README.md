# Chess-AI

This is my personal project to build a simple chess AI from scratch.  
The main goal is to create a console-based chess game where I can play against the AI,  
and then gradually improve it.

## Current status
- Project just started (no real features yet).
- Setting up GitHub + local environment.

## Next steps
- Implement a basic console chess board.
- Allow player to input moves.
- Add simple AI responses (random moves first, improve later).

## How to run
(Not available yet â€“ will be updated once the first version is ready.)
